Software is eating the world. Whether you're simply curious to learn a new technology, or want to pursue career advancement in the software industry, it is important to remain aware of the latest technology advancements and tools.


## What is Study Camp?

The goal of Study Camp is to create a _community-based_ initiative to provide _competency-based_ training for curious enthusiasts and developers alike. 

At a high level, the focus is on picking a technology or feature, and creating a multi-week schedule and milestones for a study group where members can gain competency on that topic. 

The emphasis is on _collaborative_ learning that combines the flexibility and low-costs of independent study with the accountability and support system of colleges and bootcamps. 

Study Camp was inspired by my previous experiences running the [Android Study Jam](http://developerstudyjams.com) at [Google Developer Group Hudson Valley](http://meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley) in 2015 and 2016. 

My biggest takeaways are these: 

 * anyone can learn anything if they set their mind to it
 * having a diverse group (with both experts and beginners) is key to creating an inclusive, no-judgement study group that couples empathy with expertise
 * even experts benefit - teaching someone a technology is often the best way to clarify (and enhance) your own understanding of it.
 * deadlines are important but not unique - deadlines drive progress, but its okay for different individuals to set different goals as long as they show consistent progress and gain a better understanding of the content.
 * having both Slack (online) and Meetup (in-person) options for regular meetings and discussions provides flexibility (e.g., for full-time workers or remote members) and also anonymity (e.g., removes the fear of being judged or standing out in public, particularly when you are a beginner or minority)


### What technologies are you talking about?

I hope to create camps around the following technologies in due course. In my opinion, these will provide the kind of technology understanding and software development skills that will be in demand for the next few years.

 * Firebase for real-time apps with Web, [Android](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) or [iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-ios--ud0351)
 * [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) from Python development to data science & neural networks.
 * [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Neural Network theory to practical AI and ML applications.
 * [Progressive Web Apps](https://www.udacity.com/progressive-web-apps)
 * Internet of Things
 * Android from [Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) to [Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) 


### What is this website for?

As a lifelong learner, I find that I gain expertise on a technology when I do two things: (a) build concrete projects for real-world use, and (b) teach others to do the same.

With this website, I hope to translate my "learning" process into a "sharing" one by posting articles and blog posts that relate to the above topics. My hope is to captures these in meaningful "Trails" that can then be converted into resources for future study camp sessions.

More importantly though, I view it as a way to capture popular questions or challenges in various technologies, and create an FAQ around them based on my own exploration of those ideas.
