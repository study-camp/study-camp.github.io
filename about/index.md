Study Camp is an initiative to support community-based competency-driven learning with a focus on career development. Whether you are a software professional trying to learn a new or emerging technology, or an absolute beginner looking to explore a career in software development -- this is for you.

The idea is simple. 

There is a lot of content out there, and many different paths that you could take to learn and grow your expertise. But working alone is hard, not just from a motivation standpoint, but also because you will not benefit from the questions and insights of others. At the same time, immersive learning options (bootcamps, colleges) may not be cost-effective, particularly if you are still in the early exploratory stage where you still need to decide what path to take.

With Study Camps, my goal is to create and share content that falls into a progressive sequence of learning steps, but that could then be used in small community-based study groups to support collaborative learning. The idea is built on the success of the [Android Study Jam](https://developerstudyjams.com) events that we ran successfully at [Google Developer Group Hudson Valley](http://meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley) in the past two years. 

Working with others, particularly in a diverse study group, can be just the motivation and community you need to get to the finish line.
