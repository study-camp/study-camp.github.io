Study Camp is an initiative to support community-based competency-driven learning with a focus on career development. 

Whether you are a software professional trying to learn a new or emerging technology, or an absolute beginner looking to explore a career in software development -- this is for you.


### What is the goal?

The main goal is to learn new technologies as a group, working in multi-week _sprints_ that focus either on completing a specific course, or working on a related project that provides applied understanding of the concepts.

The Study Camp will consist of in-person events (1-day workshops or a series of meetups) that is scheduled according to a specific roadmap for that technology. This website serves primarily to provide supplementary resources and articles for both group participants and those studying independently.

For instance, the [Firebase](http://study.camp/firebase/) track on this site will be used to create a curriculum  & schedule for learning how to use Firebase to develop full-stack applications. Once completed, it will serve as the roadmap for the first in-person Firebase Camp.


### What technologies will be covered?

The long-term goal is to focus on the technologies listed below.

 * Firebase for real-time apps with Web, [Android](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) or [iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-ios--ud0351)
 * [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) from Python development to data science & neural networks.
 * [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Neural Network theory to practical AI and ML applications.
 * [Progressive Web Apps](https://www.udacity.com/progressive-web-apps)
 * Internet of Things
 * Android from [Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) to [Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) 

Putting materials together and creating schedules for each, will take time. Expect there to be one Study Camp per quarter to start. As mentioned before, Firebase will be the first focus.

### What are the linked courses above?

I've linked each technology to a related [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) course or path where possible. 

Udacity has both free and paid content options, with content being created and developed by industry experts. 

Their _free_ content is ideal for group study, to learn foundational concepts. It also helps you get a sense of whether you have the right background or prerequisites to complete the materials.

Once you have mastered the basics, their _paid_ option is worth following. You will have the benefit of a project portfolio, accreditation for the course, and career development services and support.

**Note:** Study Camp is _NOT_ affiliated with Udacity in any official capacity. However, I have worked with them on previous _Android Study Jam_ and _Machine Learning Study Camp_ events at (GDG Hudson Valley)[https://meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley] and (GDG New York City)[https://meetup.com/gdgnyc] - and am a huge fan of their content and approach to learning.
