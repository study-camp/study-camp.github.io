Study Camp is an initiative to support community-based competency-driven learning with a focus on career development. 

Whether you are a software professional trying to learn a new or emerging technology, or an absolute beginner looking to explore a career in software development -- this is for you.


### What is the goal?

The main goal is to learn new technologies as a group, working in multi-week _sprints_ that focus either on completing a specific course, or working on a related project that provides applied understanding of the concepts.

The Study Camp will consist of in-person events (1-day workshops or a series of meetups) that is scheduled according to a specific roadmap for that technology. This website serves primarily to provide supplementary resources and articles for both group participants and those studying independently.


### What technologies will be covered?

The long-term goal is to focus on the technologies listed below.

 * Firebase for real-time apps with Web, [Android](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) or [iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-ios--ud0351)
 * [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) from Python development to data science & neural networks.
 * [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Neural Network theory to practical AI and ML applications.
 * [Progressive Web Apps](https://www.udacity.com/progressive-web-apps)
 * Internet of Things
 * Android from [Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) to [Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) 

The goal is to create materials and schedule at least one Study Camp each quarter. In the short term, the focus will be on a series of one or more Study Camps focused on [Firebase](http://study.camp/firebase/firebase-camp/)
