# Call for Participation

### Mountain #1: Firebase

_I've been using Firebase and talking about it at developer events for a few months. But I've found that I've only scratched the surface of what the platform can really do. So, in 2017, I'm tackling that mountain first. Join me._

I'm hoping to run a 1-day _Firebase Study Camp_ in Hudson Valley and/or the Capital Region (Albany area) in late February. Want to join the expedition? 
[**Sign up here**](http://bit.ly/firebase-camp-2017) and I'll notify you when I scheduled it.
