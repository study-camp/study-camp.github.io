# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Program


### Some History

My interest in machine learning started just over a year ago, thanks mostly to my work with the [Google Developer Group New York](http://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc) meetup. 

We had the immense good fortune of hearing from [Josh Gordon](https://twitter.com/random_forests) who works on [TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org) and is perhaps its most visible developer advocate at Google. Josh can explain fairly complex ideas in simple language; just watch his [Machine Learning Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) videos! More importantly, his background is more developer than data scientist and his entire presentation reinforced that message: _anyone can (and should) explore machine learning_. It wasn't just for researchers - and a fast-growing ecosystem of open-source technologies, pre-trained models and cloud-hosted services made it a commodity that was essential to any developer's toolbelt.

### Deep Learning ND Foundation Program
I've had a number of Machine Learning adventures since, but time and work conflicts kept me from making that a focus. 

So in 2017, I am challenging myself to take on and finish the [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) Nanodegree Foundation program.

I've been a fan of [Siraj Raval]("https://twitter.com/sirajology") ever since I discovered his entertaining and educational [playlists]("https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/playlists) on a variety of topics related to machine learning, deep learning and TensorFlow. And while the foundations builds on those, it basically provides clear projects that I hope will provide hands-on experience with some of the more interesting ideas. 

If you have an interest in this, I hugely recommend you follow Siraj on Twitter and subscribe to hsi channel on YouTube!


### Accountability Pledge

I've always felt I lacked a comprehensive foundation to the various tools and terminology used by the deep learning community. And this course feels ideal not just because it targets exactly that niche, but because all the projects you do along the way fall *exactly* into the domains that interest me. 

This blog post is about accountability. I start the program today. My hope is to get the lessons and projects done on time, so that I can get a second chance to revisit the Self-Driving Car ND. And to make that happen, I want to make the following commitment.

> I will post 1 blog post (or article) every day, starting Feb 1, sharing my progress and summarizing something I learnt on that section of my climb.


*Wish me luck!*
