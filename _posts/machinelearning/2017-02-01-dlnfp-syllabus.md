# Program Syllabus & Projects

The Udacity folks have a great [blog post](https://medium.com/udacity/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation-program-syllabus-in-depth-2eb19d014533#.r0kddcn69) that details the syllabus. Enrollment is closed for the first session, but I believe you can enroll now to join future cohorts.

It's a 17-week program -- though you can finish at your own pace. 

I'm listing the topics here so that I can subsequently link to my blog post or article about that week's content, as I go through the course.

 1. Types of Machine Learning (and when to use ML)
 2. Neural Network Architecture and Types
 3. Cloud Computing and Sentiment Analysis
 4. Math Notation and Recommender Systems
 5. Data preparation (cleaning, regularization, dimensionality reduction) 
 6. Drone image tracking
 7. Prediction
 8. Art generation
 9. Music generation (LSTMs applied to audio)
 10. Poetry Generation (LSTMs applied to NLP)
 11. Language translation (sequence to sequence)
 12. Chatbot QA System with Voice
 13. Game Bot 2D (reinforcement learning via Monte-Carlo tree search)
 14. Image Compression
 15. Data Visualization
 16. Image Generation
 17. One-shot Learning (Probabilistic Learning)

 1. Your First Neural Network. _Build a simple network to make predictions of bike-sharing usage._
 2. Object Recognition. _Build a neural network that detects objects from images._
 3. Generate TV Scripts _Use deep learning to generate new scripts for your favorite TV show._
 4. Make a translation chatbot. _Build a chatbot that translates text in real time._
 5. Generate Faces. _Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel faces._
