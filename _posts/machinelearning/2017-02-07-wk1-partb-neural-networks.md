# Accountability: Progress Report (Tue, Feb 7)

> **TL;DR**
> 
> I am a lifelong learner and autodidact currently invested in growing my understanding of machine learning and deep learning. So I enrolled in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations, a 17-week curriculum that covers key topics and concepts. I'm using these posts to keep myself accountable by sharing my progress and goals for each week.
