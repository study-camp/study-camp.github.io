This is an attempt to capture the broad topics and questions that developers have around Firebase development in a single curriculum page. I will update this list to reflect new and popular topics as the technology evolves.

Each question will (in due course) be linked to an article on this site that provides answers based on my understanding and exploration of that topic. I hope to keep those linked pages updated over time, so that this effectively provides an FAQ on that topic.

**Objectives**:  Get foundational understanding of what Firebase is, and what tools and features it provides to developers of mobile and web applications. Then get a deeper understanding of specific features or limitations, that build upon this foundation. Finally, explore additional tools and features that can take your application to the next level in terms of increasing user adoption or generating revenue.
