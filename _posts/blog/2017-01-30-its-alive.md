# Welcome 

> You're off to Great Places! <br/>
> Today is your day! <br/>
> Your mountain is waiting.<br/>
> So .. get on your way!! <br/>

>   _"Oh, the places you'll go"_ </br>
>   by Dr. Seuss

That has always been one of my favorite quotes. And while I have never been mountaineering (does hiking small hills count?), I've always felt that mountain-climbing to be a perfect analogy for lifelong learning. 

In both cases, the journey may be rough - but the summit is always worth the effort it took to get there. For the smaller mountains, you can go it alone. But when you attempt the more challenging trails, conventional wisdom says that you should attempt it as a team, and that having a trail guide who knows the way can make a big difference. 

Within that team, there will always be mountaineers with different levels of expertise. Some may have climbed it before, and want to do it again just to see if the view has changed. Others may have never climbed before. But the summit is a shared goal, and they know that getting there is easier with friends to share the journey.

And that is the philosophy for study camps. 

Every technology is a new mountain to climb. The first may be tough but the next will be easier. By the third, you will be eagerly anticipating the challenge. And by the fourth, you may well be the guide for others.


### So, what is a Study Camp?

The main goal of Study Camp is to support community-based learning of software development tools and technologies. This includes creating and identifying the right resources (e.g., content, articles etc), _establishing a schedule_ that allows for group study, and scheduling regular online or in-person events to track and encourage progress towards goals.

This website will serve as a repository for collecting content and resources, and announcing events for in-person study camps when appropriate. Content will be in the form of articles (that focus specifically on development and code) and blog posts (that focus more on real-world applications or challenges).


### What will Study Camp focus on?

In 2017, I hope to explore some of the following technologies. 

Where relevant, I linked to [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) courses or content that will be useful targets and resources for our study groups. The focus of the study group is to provide a regular schedule (and peer encouragement) to complete projects and content related to a specific chosen path. With Udacity, you can also join paid _nanodegree_ programs to gain accreditation, project portfolio and career development support to take you to the next level.

### What's the next step?

_Stay tuned!_

I'm currently planning a 1-day _Firebase Study Camp_ that will be held in the Capital Region (greater Albany, NY area) in February. 

Interested in joining us? [**Sign up here**](http://bit.ly/firebase-camp-2017) and I'll notify you when the event is scheduled.
