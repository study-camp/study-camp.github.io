# Welcome 

> You're off to Great Places! <br/>
> Today is your day! <br/>
> Your mountain is waiting.<br/>
> So .. get on your way!! <br/>

>   _"Oh, the places you'll go"_ </br>

That has always been one of my favorite quotes. And while I have never been mountaineering (does hiking small hills count?), I've always felt that mountain-climbing to be a perfect analogy for lifelong learning. 

In both cases, the journey may be rough - but the summit is always worth the effort it took to get there. For the smaller mountains, you can go it alone. But when you attempt the more challenging trails, conventional wisdom says that you should attempt it as a team, and that having a trail guide who knows the way can make a big difference. 

Within that team, there will always be mountaineers with different levels of expertise. Some may have climbed it before, and want to do it again just to see if the view has changed. Others may have never climbed before. But the summit is a shared goal, and they know that getting there is easier with friends to share the journey.

And that is the philosophy for study camps. 

Every technology is a new mountain to climb. The first may be tough but the next will be easier. By the third, you will be eagerly anticipating the challenge. And by the fourth, you may well be the guide for others.




### What's the next step?

_Stay tuned!_

I'm currently planning a 1-day _Firebase Study Camp_ that will be held in the Capital Region (greater Albany, NY area) in February. 

Interested in joining us? [**Sign up here**](http://bit.ly/firebase-camp-2017) and I'll notify you when the event is scheduled.
