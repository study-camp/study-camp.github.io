Hello and welcome to _Study Camp_.

### What is Study Camp?

The main goal of Study Camp is to create materials, identify resources and organize events that support community-based learning of software development tools and technologies.

The website itself will be used to both collect existing resources, and create study guides and articles that can be used to support related events. In this context, an "event" is a multi-week study group that will focus on learning a specific technology using a combination of online content and in-person talks and meetups, to support collaborative learning of that technology.

### What will Study Camp focus on?

In 2017, I hope to explore some of the following technologies. 

Where relevant, I linked to [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) courses or content that will be useful targets and resources for our study groups. The focus of the study group is to provide a regular schedule (and peer encouragement) to complete projects and content related to a specific chosen path. With Udacity, you can also join paid _nanodegree_ programs to gain accreditation, project portfolio and career development support to take you to the next level.

 * Firebase for real-time apps with Web, [Android](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352) or [iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-ios--ud0351)
 * [Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) from Python development to data science & neural networks.
 * [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Neural Network theory to practical AI and ML applications.
 * [Progressive Web Apps](https://www.udacity.com/progressive-web-apps)
 * Internet of Things
 * Android from [Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) to [Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) 


### What's the next step?

_Stay tuned!_

I'm currently planning a 1-day _Firebase Study Camp_ that will be held in the Capital Region (greater Albany, NY area) in February. Interested in joining us? [**Sign up here**](http://bit.ly/firebase-camp-2017) and I'll notify you when the event is scheduled.
